    <h1>Homeowners of Rexburg!</h1>

    <p>Most every homeowner in Rexburg is unaware of an ordinance that is enforced by the City of Rexburg that has been on the books for years. It is called:</p>

    <h2>The Local Improvement District law (LID)</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Local Improvement Districts (LID) are administered by the Engineering Department to fund infrastructure improvements. The authority and procedures for LID’s is found in Idaho State Code, Title 50 Chapter 17.</li>
        <li>A Local Improvement District (LID) provides a way for property owners to get together to pay for street and alley paving, sanitary sewers, street lighting or underground wiring.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In short, this means that when the City of Rexburg deems it necessary to replace the road, alleys, sewer pipes, street lighting or underground wiring in front of your home, <strong>YOU</strong> will be responsible to pay a percentage of that billing for the said repairs & replacements from one side of your property to the other up to the middle of the road.</p>

    <p><strong>Kieth Davidson</strong>, from the city office, states that payment is made by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paying in full to the City of Rexburg</li>
        <li>Paying to the city through a 10 year loan with interest via a separate bill included in your utility bill</li>
        <li>Paying to the city via a loan of your choice</li>
        <li>If payment is not made, upon completion, the City of Rexburg will fix a lien to your property.</li>
        <li><strong>ALSO</strong> - if you are a homeowner that lives on a corner property, you will be assessed for both sides of your property that is attached to the street the city will be replacing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In most cities, homeowners pay annual taxes that fund maintenance & repair of their city’s infrastructure. There is no unrealistic additional payments, loans, interest and liens added for property tax payments because the costs come from the city’s budget. Therefore, it is the city’s responsibility to balance. Yet, people who move here are unaware of the city ordinance mentioned above! It is a financial burden for Rexburg homeowners to pay in one lump sum or by a loan with interest.</p>

    <p>Citizens who have already been victims of this ordinance report damage to their property by third parties doing the repairs, with many not mitigating the damages left in their wake, resulting in additional costs to the homeowners to restore their property. Many report being left with extremely poor quality workmanship of concrete sidewalks and gutters, worse than the original concrete. It is common to be charged higher than your assessment, averaging anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000+ per home. There are many stories and more information regarding this law and the hardships it has caused for Rexburg residents. The Park Street residents are only one of these such stories.</p>

    <h2>Changes are needed to do away with the LID ordinance!</h2>

    <p><strong>ALL</strong> homeowners in Rexburg will be affected at some point or other, if not already!</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>WHAT CAN BE DONE?</h2>

    <p>Most city leaders are banking on homeowners to forget about the LID’s so they can keep perpetuating this ordinance at our expense. Educate yourself about this ordinance, share it with others, watch for community signs, Facebook posts etc. and attend a city council meeting when LID’s are on the agenda.</p>

    <p>It will take a total city upheaval - a combined effort - of <strong>ALL</strong> of its citizens to fight this ordinance and vote to move to a yearly tax levy! A levy that would cost homeowners very little yearly.</p>

    <p>We are all busy, but now is not the time to be complacent.<br>
    Homeowners can’t <strong>$$ AFFORD $$</strong> to be.</p>
